So I saw the Spotify Car Thing online and bro, it looked so clean. Minimal, functional, and honestly, just a vibe. But when I checked the price online, it was totally crazy — like ₹15,000 or more. Apparently they discontinued it, and now everyone is just reselling it for insane prices. That’s when I had this lightbulb moment — “Why not build it myself?” I already had an ESP32 lying around, and I’d been wanting to try a custom PCB build with some real-world use. That’s how this whole thing began.
